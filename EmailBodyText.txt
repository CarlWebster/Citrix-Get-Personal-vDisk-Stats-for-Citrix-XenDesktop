
Your Personal vDisk space has reached over 90% of its capacity.   
You should resolve this as soon as possible before your Personal vDisk fills up and needs to be reset.  
When that happens, you will need to reinstall your applications.

You should move your ‘User Data’ from your C and or PvD drive and it should be kept on your home drive.  
The free space on your workstation is to be used for application installs, temp files, and other general 
system and application configurations.

Let us know if you need any help.

Thanks
